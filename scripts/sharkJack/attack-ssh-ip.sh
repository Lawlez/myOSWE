# It enables the SSH server, attempts to get an IP address from DHCP (Attack Mode default)

# then blinks the last octet of the IP address. Perfect for most /24 (255.255.255.0) home networks.

# Plug the Shark Jack into your home network, wait ~45 seconds and it will blink cyan

# four times, pause, then blink twice. This indicates that the last octet of its IP address is

# .42 - so if your home LAN is 192.168.1.0, then your Shark Jack should be found at 192.168.1.42

#

# If one of the octets is zero this will be represented as solid for 1 second.

#

# Magenta...........Setup

# Red Slow Blink....Failed to obtain IP address

# Cyan Fast Blink...A non-zero digit of last octet

# Cyan Solid........A zero digit of last octet
